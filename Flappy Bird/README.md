<H1 style="text-align: center">  About This Project </H1>

This is a guided project I am Making to enhance my Python coding skils. This shall be a GUI version of the game Flappy Bird. This is the first time I shall be making any thing ohter than Console. **This is my first Interaction with GUI**  :smile:

The Things I think I am going to learn from this project are listed in [Learnings](#learnings). And the reason for selecting this as a project is in the [Why](#why) section.
The Source of learning is given in the [Refercnce](#refercnce). I have already learnd all the concepts of python form same source and time to make a real project.

## :open_file_folder: Files
All the required modules and their used version are listed in [this file](./requirements.txt).

All the code related to loading the images and the sound files are in the [this file](./load.py). This file is getting imported and function here are used for importing the files.<br>
All the Constant Global variables which are getting used in every place are in [seprate file](globalVar.py). There are kept constant throughout the program.

<!-- Something about the files of the Project here -->

The Game code and logic is in the file **[game.py](./game.py)** <br>
Where as the main file is which contains all the preplaying setup and other stuff are in **[main.py](./main.py)**

## :student: Why
The Major reason of selecting this as project is Learn who GUI Applications are created and Create then using python.Since I have started coding I have only done it in console. I always wanted to witness how GUI interactive Applications are created. I always wanted to learn the automation and what bwtter could be. What better thing can be ny creating a game which we always play when we were child.

## :writing_hand: Learnings
These is going to be a great learning process as there are many small project that I have done but this is the first time I am making a GUI project. <br>
I am looking forward to use all the things that I have learned in this journey and making something that would atleast help me. Although it might not be ground breaking but would be helpful for me I could play a game created by me when I am off.<br>
This is going to involve the use of many modules that I hardly heard of. That is going to give me exposure to many new things.

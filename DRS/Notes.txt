Tkinter -> Used to create GUI Application using python 
    This is a preinstalled module

    Running of the mainloop is the MOST IMPORTANT thing else the program will crash

    The Docs can be read form (effbot.org/tkinterbook)

We will be using the OpenCV module to work in this project file

PIL is python Imaging Library -> This is used for all the stuff related images in python

tk.Tk() -> Creates the window of the software

OpenCV
    cvtcolor -> This would read the imgae and conver the colors to RGB Format
    

Canvas
    Canvas work reqires the designing part
    Canvas.pack() -> sets ot to the screen


Buttons
    tk.Button() -> This func is used to create button on the window
    Window -> In which window button is to be displayed
    text -> Text inside the button
    width -> Width of the button
    command -> Runs the given Function as the arg when button is pressed
        We cant give the argument here for the function. If the function requiers the arg 
        for this we use the *partial module*

    Pending()
        we are reading the imgae
        Resizing it using imutils
        Converting it to a tkinter compatiable Image
        * frame is a array
        


Threading Module :
    using This will allow us to stop the blockage of the program 
    We will create a thread that will manage the work to change the image   

    td.thread() -> Creates the thread obj for the work
    target -> The function which we want to execute
    Agrs -> Arguments to be passed as a touple

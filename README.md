## :card_index_dividers: About the Repo
This Repo is created to keep the records of all the projects that I am making in different Languages like Python and C++. 

Some of them will be guided Projects and Some would be completely made my me only.

Some stuff which are common to all the repos like the [.gitignore](./.gitignore) file content are in the Main only and some may contain their own files like `.gitignore`.

## :open_file_folder: The subrepos
Every project that I will make will be in seprate directory and each directory will have its own README.md file and some important stuff which shoud be there in the repo. Each repo also contains all the required files related to that project. 

Get to any repo go through `README.md` file to know more about the repo/Project

## :shrug: Why 
Making projects (although small) gives me confidence that I am doing something and I even get a better command in the skill.

Other than developing the skill this helps me a lot to keep track of what I am doing. Everytime I dont have to start from the absolute basics.

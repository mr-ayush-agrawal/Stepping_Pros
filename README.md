## Why 
Making projects (although small) gives me confidence that I am doing something and I even get a better command in the skill.

Other than developing the skill this helps me a lot to keep track of what I am doing. Everytime I dont have to start from the absolute basics.

## About the Repo
This Repo is made to create the basic projects which I will be making while learning different stuffs 

Some of them will be guided Projects and Some would be completely made my me only

## The subrepos
Every project that I will make will be in seprate directory and each directory will have its own README.md file and some important stuff which shoud be there in the repo.

# Small Projects Codes
This Contains all the small basic codes that I write during Revising the language or makking some mini projects codes that are generally completed in a single file.

The Main Sources of the codes are form the [Youtube](https://youtube.com) Videos single small projects or the Part of some Video of the crators.

I shall be trying to keep all the codes in this folder which would be there with the youtube creator's link.

## All Projects
There are link to the code in my repo as well as there is the link to the video which I would be following for making that mini project in the table below.

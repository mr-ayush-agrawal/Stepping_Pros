# Hangman Game

## About the Game
This is a kind of guessing game where you have to guess the English word in a given limited number of tries if you guess it right the man lives else the hanging man dies.

The aim of the game is **SAVE THE HANGING MAN**

More Rules would be updated later.

## About the Project
This is a game which I am making as a guided work. The reference is taken form this video of [Free Code Camp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg&list=WL) Project - 5

The game would be in python as I am looking forward to strong my concepts in the language

## What I think I will learn form this
I will start writing the code. Currently I think the code in my head and leave it there only. This shall help me to work with this.

I haven't written any effictive code in python. As I have learned this language recently. This will help me to gain confidence in the language.

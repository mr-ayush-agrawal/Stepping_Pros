<H1 style="text-align: center">  About This Project </H1>

This is a guided project I am Making to enhance my Python coding skils. Although this project name is jarvis but this is a desktop assistant that operates on Voice Command. I shall be making one later with the openAI's API of ChatGPT which will be a better desktop assistant can could be able to do many more things but that is the next level of the program. :smile:

The Things I think I am going to learn from this project are listed in [Learnings](#learnings). And the reason for selecting this as a project is in the [Why](#why) section.
The Source of learning is given in the [Refercnce](#refercnce). I have already learnd all the concepts of python form same source and time to make a real project.

## :open_file_folder: Files
All the required modules and their used version are listed in [this file](./requirements.txt).

The logs of the commands given are store in the [file](./logs.txt). This refreshes everytime the program is run. This would store the Time stamp of the Starting the Program and Audio inputs with time stamp. Everytime the program is run the file resets. This file won't be visible as due to update in every run this is ignored by git.

The Main code is in the file **[JARVIS.py](./jarvis.py)**

## :student: Why
The Major reason of selecting this as project is Working with many modules simultaneously. Over working on many modules I always admire the power of tech what it is able to do and its capacity. I always wanted to learn the automation and what bwtter could be. Doing all the things you wanted in a single project.

## :writing_hand: Learnings
These is going to be a great learning process as there are only mini projects that I have made while programming and this shall be my first major project. <br>
I am looking forward to use all the things that I have learned in this journey and making something that would atleast help me. Although it might not be ground breaking but would be helpful a lot to automate many daily stuffs for me.<br>
This is going to involve the use of many modules that I hardly heard of. That is going to give me exposure to many new things.

I would be adding my things to this project too that are not in the video of reference. This would also help me to grow a lot.

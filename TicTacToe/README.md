# Tic Tac Toe

## About the Game
This is the basic game of Playing Tic-Tac-Toe. Where A player uses the either of the X/O symbol to play.

The [Rules](./Rules.py) of the game will be displayed each time when the player start the game.

## About the Project
This is a game which I am making as a Personal Project. I think Making this kind of small projects helps a lot in learning anyhting in the life of anyone. I will be using the concepts of OOPs which I recently learned in Python.
I had a similar Project which I made during my school days that was in c++. That wasn't made by using OOPs that was just a procedure oriented programming. So I think this is a good time to work on it again. Although I have lost that code but would be great to work on the same thing but in a challenging way.

The game would be in python as I am looking forward to strong my concepts in the language


## What I think I will learn form this
I will start writing the code. Currently I think the code in my head and leave it there only. This shall help me to work with this.

I haven't written any effictive code in python. As I have learned this language recently. This will help me to gain confidence in the language.

Working with multiple source code files. I have crated a long program but never worked with the multiple file having the source code for a single program.

And of cause the experience making something related to real world using the concept of OOPs so better in that way also.


# Tic Tac Toe - AI

## About the game
This is going to be the AI version of the game. Here the AI never loses the game. It either wins the board or ends up to a draw.

### Algoritham 
The AI algorithim used here is the min-max by which computer Identify the best possible position to play the move.

## About the project 
The earlier Version which is without AI and has only the random number generator and the Multiplayer was made with the concept of the classes and objects.<br>
This AI version is made without using the Classes. 

**Concider both as the different entities** as they are not at all related.

This is basically taken the reference from a video of DevTown on Youtube.
